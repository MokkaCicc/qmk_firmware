# MokkaCicc's Keymap

This keymap is heavily designed for programming, the main key features are:
- [COLEMAK layout](https://colemak.com/)
- shift, control, atl and os keys on the home rows (holding)
- navigation layer (see `_NAVIGATION` layer)
- more accessible brackets on the `_SYMBOLS` layer
- numbers and symbols on the home rows (see `_NUMBERS` and `_SYMBOLS` layers)
- [Caps Word](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_caps_word)
- `_CONFIG` layer to quickly switch to QWERTY without any weird mods (useful for gaming)
- French characters on the `_SYMBOLS` layer
